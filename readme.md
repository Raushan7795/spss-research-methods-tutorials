# SPSS Research Methods

This repository contains a set of tutorials that I have used to teach research
methods to I/O psychology students.
A particular emphasis is on using syntax, reproducible workflow in SPSS,
managing metadata, and scale construction.

It contains six tutorial exercises.

* Introduction to data analysis
* Correlation and regression
* Group differences
* Moderators and mediators
* Exploratory factor analysis
* Confirmatory factor analysis


Each exercise includes several folders

* **Instructions**: This folder includes one or more Word documents with the
  exercise and answers.
* **data**: This folder includes raw data and meta data used in the tutorial
  exercises. There are often raw csv files as well as various SPSS sav files.
The exercises are designed to teach students how to import and process csv files
in SPSS.
* **output**: These folders often include a copy of much of the SPSS output in
  PDF form as well as some syntax files.

To use the repository it is recommended that you download the [ZIP
file](https://github.com/jeromyanglim/spss-research-methods-tutorials/archive/master.zip).

Earlier versions of the corresponding lectures can basically be found in the [teaching resources
section of my website](http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com.au/2009/09/teaching-resources.html)
under multivariate methods.
